"""`format.parseIntegerStrictly` against the function it claims to reproduce.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Inventory :501 and :962 both hang a dialog off a bare ``int()`` raising
ValueError, so "is this an integer" is a question CPython answers and the
frontend has to give the same answer. The helper's docstring said so from the
start; its implementation was ``/^[+-]?\\d+$/``, which is JavaScript's answer.
The two disagree on real input:

* ``int("1_0")`` is 10 and the regex refused it;
* ``int()`` accepts every Unicode decimal digit, and the regex accepted only
  ``0-9`` - so an Arabic keyboard's ten was "not a valid number for total
  tracks" in the browser and a 10-track set in Tkinter.

A hand-written table of cases would have missed both, because both are things
you have to already know to write down. So the oracle here is ``int()`` itself,
run over a corpus derived from ``int()`` itself: **every Unicode decimal digit
there is**, and **every character it strips from the ends of its argument**. If
JavaScript and Python disagree about any code point, or about any of the grammar
around it, this fails and names the input.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK
----------------------
Magnitude. Python's integers are unbounded and JavaScript's arrive as a
float64, so the corpus stops well inside ``Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER``. That
limit is documented on the helper and is fifteen orders of magnitude past
``MAX_SET_TRACKS``; it is a real difference and it is not one this can close.
